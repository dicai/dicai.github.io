      <title>Priors on exchangeable directed graphs</title>

      <description>Directed graphs occur throughout statistical modeling of networks, and exchangeability is a natural assumption when the ordering of vertices does not matter. There is a deep structural theory for exchangeable undirected graphs, which extends to the directed case via measurable objects known as digraphons &amp;hellip;</description>
