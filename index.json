It is common to use a Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) for this purpose. But Miller and Harrison (2013) warn that the DPMM posterior is severely inconsistent for the number of clusters when the data are truly generated from a finite mixture; that is, the posterior probability of the true number of clusters goes to zero in the limit of infinite data. A potential alternative is to use a finite mixture model (FMM) with a prior on the number of clusters. Past work has shown the resulting posterior in this case is consistent. But these results crucially depend on the assumption that the cluster likelihoods are perfectly specified. In practice, this assumption is unrealistic, and empirical evidence (Miller and Dunson, 2018) suggests that the posterior on the number of clusters is sensitive to the likelihood choice. In this paper, we prove that under even the slightest model misspecification, the FMM posterior on the number of components is also severely inconsistent. We support our theory with empirical results on simulated and real data sets.","tags":["preprint"],"title":"Finite mixture models are typically inconsistent for the number of components","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin","Rishit Sheth","Lester Mackey","Nicolo Fusi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"806b788a6e766cb3164929a3a5a9f435","permalink":"https://dicai.github.io/publication/conference-paper/2020-weighted-maml/","publishdate":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/2020-weighted-maml/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["meta-learning"],"title":"Weighted meta-learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin","Trevor Campbell","Tamara Broderick"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"8f54f8f5d9cd75a471ee6dc1f5904a0d","permalink":"https://dicai.github.io/publication/conference-paper/2019-finmix/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/2019-finmix/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["workshop"],"title":"Finite mixture models are typically inconsistent for the number of components","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin","Michael Mitzenmacher","Ryan P.

The count-min sketch and related hash-based data structures are ubiquitous in systems that must track frequencies of data such as URLs, IP addresses, and language n-grams. We present a Bayesian view on the count-min sketch, using the same data structure, but providing a posterior distribution over the frequencies that characterizes the uncertainty arising from the hash-based approximation. In particular, we take a nonparametric approach and consider tokens generated from a Dirichlet process (DP) random measure, which allows for an unbounded number of unique tokens. Using properties of the DP, we show that it is possible to straightforwardly compute posterior marginals of the unknown true counts and that the modes of these marginals recover the count-min sketch estimator, inheriting the associated probabilistic guarantees. Using simulated data and text data, we investigate the properties of these estimators. Lastly, we also study a modified problem in which the observation stream consists of collections of tokens (i.e., documents) arising from a random measure drawn from a stable beta process, which allows for power law scaling behavior in the number of unique tokens.","tags":["probmodeling"],"title":"A Bayesian nonparametric view on count-min sketch","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor Campbell","admin","Tamara Broderick"],"categories":null,"content":"Preliminary version in the NIPS 2016 Workshop on Practical Bayesian Nonparametrics, 2016.

Often the data are also exchangeable, i.e., their joint distribution is invariant to reordering. In clustering—a special case of trait allocation—exchangeability implies the existence of both a de Finetti representation and an exchangeable partition probability function (EPPF), distributional representations useful for computational and theoretical purposes. In this work, we develop the analogous de Finetti representation and exchangeable trait probability function (ETPF) for trait allocations, along with a characterization of all trait allocations with an ETPF. Unlike previous feature allocation characterizations, our proofs fully capture single-occurrence “dust” groups. We further introduce a novel constrained version of the ETPF that we use to establish an intuitive connection between the probability functions for clustering, feature allocations, and trait allocations. As an application of our general theory, we characterize the distribution of all edge-exchangeable graphs, a class of recently-developed models that captures realistic sparse graph sequences.","tags":["publication"],"title":"Exchangeable trait allocations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin","Trevor Campbell","Tamara Broderick"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"31d0bb8d44d39562d7b1582f3f39abe8","permalink":"https://dicai.github.io/publication/conference-paper/2017-finmix/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/2017-finmix/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["workshop"],"title":"Finite mixture models are typically inconsistent for the number of components","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"e368e80244db4f7a9c74bc3236074d9e","permalink":"https://dicai.github.io/post/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Funding Resources for Junior Women in CS, Stats, Machine Learning","type":"post"},{"authors":["admin","Trevor Campbell","Tamara Broderick"],"categories":null,"content":"Preliminary versions appeared as:   Completely random measures for modeling power laws in sparse graphs.

However, the Aldous-Hoover theorem guarantees that these graphs are dense or empty with probability one, whereas many real-world graphs are sparse. We present an alternative notion of exchangeability for random graphs, which we call edge exchangeability, in which the distribution of a graph sequence is invariant to the order of the edges. We demonstrate that edge-exchangeable models, unlike models that are traditionally vertex exchangeable, can exhibit sparsity. To do so, we outline a general framework for graph generative models; by contrast to the pioneering work of Caron and Fox [12], models within our framework are stationary across steps of the graph sequence. In particular, our model grows the graph by instantiating more latent atoms of a single random measure as the dataset size increases, rather than adding new atoms to the measure.","tags":["publication"],"title":"Edge-exchangeable graphs and sparsity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin","Trevor Campbell","Tamara Broderick"],"categories":null,"content":"This article focuses on the graph paintbox.
